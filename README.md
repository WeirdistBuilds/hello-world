Kyle Hinckley - "Hello World" project for DGM-1660

Hi! My name is Kyle Hinckley.
I've played video games my entire life, and streamed on Twitch full-time for two years.
Before that, I was a landscaper and listened to 4 books a week for twelve years.
I live with my smartass brother, beautiful girlfriend and hard-working cat near UVU.
In a week I'm leaving for Burning Man, my fifth year in a row. I run a bar out there.
Life's good.
