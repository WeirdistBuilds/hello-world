Notes: I've gutted the build somewhat, but this is much cleaner, less costly and contains nearly everything. With this, you have only two weapon perks plus Demolition Expert, and you'll have access to all the elements. I've cut the Missile Launcher and sniper rifles, you'll do better with the automatic stuff and it's best if you get closer so your companion can tank for you, and I’ve added Heavy Gunner to increase the damage from the Cryolator and Flamer. You will also be able to make all the different grenades.

This build is very squishy, no Endurance and no Sneak, it's fully capable of using power armor but it's best if you simply hang back and let your companion tank for you. Speaking of, did you know your companion is more effective with higher Charisma? I issued you a few points at the end and access to the Inspirational perk, you'll want to take Inspirational 2 as soon as you can, and maybe even 3. You are ranged, DeathTrap must be your melee tank.

I've cut Strong Back and Locksmith because your companion should do those things for you. A robot mod can unlock any lock and with further armor additions to a robot, they can carry a crazy amount. If you feel you must have the Cryolator immediately, swap out Hacker for Locksmith. 

Finally, because I know you won't have access to the Robotics Workshop until level 10-20, all of the upgrade perks for robots are taken around that time. You'll still be able to get your armor and weapons up, find ammo, buy your first couple of weapons and survive using Codsworth or another companion (you could even dress up your other companions as the other vault hunters, squee!)

Lastly, you should be able to get the Spray and Pray right away, but don't forget to replace it with the Kiloton Radium Rifle when you get to Far Harbor. You will need to remember to grab the Tesla Rifle when you're in the Fort Hagen Satellite Array during Automatron, and upgrade it to automatic. You'll also need to remember to upgrade your plasma weapon with the thrower mod to benefit from Commando. You can buy one in the Institute, but the legendary effect is not great for you. The ammo you’ll need to begin hoarding is the .45 ammo, fusion cells, plasma cartridges, cryo cells and flamer fuel.

And that's it! I hope this build works out more precisely for you.
